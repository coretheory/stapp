			<p class="text-left mb-3">I am an interdisciplinary designer, formally trained in the architecture industry. As an entrprenuer and co-founder, I am passionate about projects and careers that shatter boundaries. With a diverse and novel toolset that encompasses both the business and creative scope, I enjoy creating spaces and products that captivate one's presence and engage the imagination.</p>
			<p class="text-left font-light text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">My formal training in architecture transpired at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), culminating in my B.Arch degree in 2018. During my studies, I interned at various award-winning firms and received awards for my academic work, including a 2018 Thesis Merit Prize and 1st Place in Sun-Cal's Flat Figures competition in 2015. I also served as the 2018 Editor-in-Chief for Underscore's fourth publication, HB+C, and as Academic Councilor for the bachelor's program at SCI-Arc.</p>
			<p class="text-left font-light text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">After graduation, I dove head-first into the entreprenurial world, co-founding a 100% remote, public benefit, creative and game development studio, Core Theory, with my fianc√©. It has been an exciting and insightful experience that has involved business administration, illustration, 3d modeling, character rigging, marketing, and graphic design work. We are proud to be partnered with 1% For the Planet, B Lab (as a Certified B Corp pending), The Land Institute, Wild Salmon Center, Pacific Forest Trust, and the United Nations Climate Council.</p>
			<p class="text-left font-light text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">I am available for consulting and contractual work in the architectural and design industries, with a special interest in full-time employment in an architectural environment that shares my love for craft, detail, and context. I have a fully-equipped remote office capable of administering and producing in an architectural and 3d environment, as well as extensive experience and knowledge in remote work.</p>
			<p class="text-left font-light text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">Lastly, if you are simply in need of a remote consultant to help your business transition to remote work (or prepare for the future), then I can help you establish the best remote practices for a happy, productive, and successful work environment for your employees and business.</p>
