# SARATHAYER

I am an interdisciplinary designer, formally trained in the architecture industry. As an entrepreneur and co-founder, I am passionate about projects and careers that shatter boundaries. With a diverse and novel toolset that encompasses both the business and creative scope, I enjoy creating spaces and products that captivate one's presence and engage the imagination.
