# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      about_intro: "I am an interdisciplinary designer, formally trained in the architecture industry. As an entrepreneur and co-founder, I am passionate about projects and careers that shatter boundaries. With a diverse and novel toolset that encompasses both the business and creative scope, I enjoy creating spaces and products that captivate one's presence and engage the imagination."
      about_paragraph_one: "My formal training in architecture transpired at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), culminating in my B.Arch degree in 2018. During my studies, I interned at various award-winning firms and received awards for my academic work, including a 2018 Thesis Merit Prize and 1st Place in Sun-Cal's Flat Figures competition in 2015. I also served as the 2018 Editor-in-Chief for Underscore's fourth publication, HB+C, and as Academic Councilor for the bachelor's program at SCI-Arc."
      about_paragraph_two: "After graduation, I dove head-first into the entrepreneurial world, co-founding a 100% remote, public benefit, creative and game development studio, Core Theory, with my fianc√©. It has been an exciting and insightful experience that has involved business administration, illustration, 3d modeling, character rigging, marketing, and graphic design work. We are proud to be partnered with 1% For the Planet, B Lab (as a Certified B Corp pending), The Land Institute, Wild Salmon Center, Pacific Forest Trust, SAVE, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."
      about_paragraph_three: "I am available for consulting and contractual work in the architectural and design industries, with a special interest in full-time employment in an architectural environment that shares my love for craft, detail, and context. I have a fully equipped remote office capable of administering and producing in an architectural and 3d environment, as well as extensive experience and knowledge in remote work."
